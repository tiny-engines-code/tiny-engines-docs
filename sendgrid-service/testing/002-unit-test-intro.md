## Unit testing 

Effective unit testing starts with modular code design.  Of course that's much easier in a textbook example like this, but for any given function -- we'll call it our function "under test" -- we should be able to define a simple set of possible inputs and possible outputs for those inputs.

<p/><strong>What is our function under test?</strong>


<p/><strong>What are the possible inputs to the function?</strong>


<p/><strong>What are the possible outputs?</strong>
