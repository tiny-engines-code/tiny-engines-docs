### <font color=teal>Problem Statement</font>

  - We want to decide whether to kick off a project that uses readily available NFL data to apply machine learning to predict NFL game outcomes

### <font color=teal>Context</font>
- The NFL has some good play-by-play data, and we'd like to understand the difficulty and feasibility of using this data as input to a machine learning projects.  

### <font color=teal>Criteria for Success</font>
- [ ] Provide a rough level-of-effort to predict NFL game outcomes using machine learning. 
- [ ] Create a proof-of-concept to show how data can be formatted as input to a machine learning model.   
- [ ] Show that the model can learn to predict NFL game outcomes better than a guess.

### <font color=teal>Scope of solution</font>
- We don't need to predict games accurately.  We just need to show that we can train a model with data that we curated to predict NFL game outcomes better than a guess.

### <font color=teal>Constraints</font>
- Because we have 2 weeks to decide whether to green-light a project to predict NFL game outcomes, we will not try to perfect either the model or the data.  
    We'll just see if we can get something working with a single input supervised model.
    We do not have access to the NFL API, which may provide better data.
