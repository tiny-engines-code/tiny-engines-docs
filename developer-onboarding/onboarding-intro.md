This is a continual work in progress pulled from various wikis and documents that I've used more than I ever expected to clarify one concept or another...  

and a reminder that in addition to "whiles" and "ifs" and "loops", a fully realized deliverable also includes:

  - **Observability - how we trace and monitor the solution**
    - monitoring - New Relic, SignalFX
    - metering - dropwizard, ...
    - tracing solution - like Zipkin
  - **Microservice ambassadors and side-cars**
    - discovery
    - circuit breaker
    - configuration and secrets management
  - **Logging and error handling solution**
    - logging strategy and utilities 
    - error handling strategy
  - **Quality control**
    - unit testing
    - integration testing
    - acceptance testing
    - performance testing
    - code quality such as lint, Jacoco, Sonarqube
    - mutation testing
    - chaos 
  - **Continuous integration and delivery**
    - build tools such as Gitlab, Jenkins, Jenkins X
    - deployment tools such as Terraform, Packer
    - Production platforms such as AWS, GKE, or Azure
    - Soft platforms such as Kubernetes
